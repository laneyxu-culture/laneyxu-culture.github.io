# About Me

I'm Laney Xu, a high school student passionate about psychology, history and cultural exchange.

## My Journey

I've been sharing Chinese culture since elementary school — with students in the US, Australia, Spain, and Mexico. 

I was a freshman in **the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University** in China, and hosted a delegation of Niles North High School，Niles West High School（IL）.

During my exchange year at **Elgin High School**in Oregan , I started the school's first Chinese Culture Club.

Now at **St. Fracias High School**in Illinois, I'm an active member of Chinese Culture Club.

## Why This Website

This site is a space to share:
- Activities and materials from our club
- Psychology projects from Culture Lab
- Stories from my exchange year
