# About Me

I'm Laney Xu, a high school student passionate about cultural exchange, psychology and history.

## My Journey

I've been sharing Chinese culture since elementary school — with students in the US, Australia, Spain, and Mexico. 

During my exchange year at **Elgin High School (Oregon)** , I started the school's first Chinese Culture Club.

Now at **SFHS**, I'm an active member of Chinese Culture Club.

## Why This Website

This site is a space to share:
- Activities and materials from our club
- Psychology projects from Culture Lab
- Stories from my exchange year
